#INFO: RichLabelTTF used to render text from true type font file, with some 
       feature, now it support feature is:
		1. multiline typo text 
		2. single word with color 



# 1. Feature color
	Programer use  setString(const char* str) interface to tell RichLabelTTF 
	to render the text they want. there some format for the string. if you 
	want to render string,like "god is a girl", with word "god" is blue and 
	"is" is red and "a girl" is white, you can write the text like this:

		 <color=#0000FF>god  <color=#FF0000>is <color=#FFFFFF>a girl 
			
		
# 2. Feature multiline
	If you want to render text with multiline, you must use string "\n",
	like the below example:

			god is a girl
			it leave in the sky  
			so we can't see it 

	you can't setting the text like this:

			god is a girl\nit leave in the sky\nso we can't see it 

# 3. Special Character
	Becase the character "<" and ">" are used for color showing, so you can't 
	directly render them. but can use  string "<lp>" and string "<rp>" 
	instead, like this:

			<computer graphics> is a good book

	so you setting the text like this 

			<lp>computer graphics<rp> is a good book
